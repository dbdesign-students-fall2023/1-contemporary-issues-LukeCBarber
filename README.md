# CNN vs. Breitbarts news coverage of Donald Trump's 2024 Presidential Campaign
In this document, I discuss two articles about President Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Trump is possibly the most contraversial president in US history. Recent events including multiple indictments and the January 6th riots have only added to this contraversial reputation. 

## Article 1
In CNN's [Trump is explaining exactly how wild and extreme his second term would be](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/politics/trump-wild-rhetoric-2024/index.html), Donald Trump, during a recent rally in South Dakota, issued a dire warning to his supporters, evoking memories of the January 6th Capitol attack, urging them to "fight like hell" to prevent losing their country. Trump accused his potential 2024 opponent, President Joe Biden, of orchestrating his indictment on 91 criminal charges as a form of election interference. In a dystopian speech, he claimed that the nation had never seen such darkness, accusing Democrats of allowing a "migrant invasion" at the southern border and attempting to reignite COVID-19 hysteria. Trump's rhetoric raised concerns about a potentially more extreme second term that would challenge the rule of law. He implied that the real threat to democracy came from efforts to hold him accountable for his actions rather than from his attempts to overturn a fair election. Trump's ability to inject falsehoods and conspiracy theories into the political discourse continues to shape public opinion, with only 28% of Republicans believing Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, despite multiple court rejections of Trump's challenges.



## Article 2
In Breitbart's [Trump Rocks Iowa-Iowa State Game: Parties with Frat, Flips Burgers, Throws Footballs](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/09/09/trump-rocks-iowa-iowa-state-game-parties-with-frat-flips-burgers-throws-footballs/) They write about Trump's recent trip to a recent match between Iowa State University and the University of Iowa in Ames, Iowa, visiting the Alpha Gamma Rho (AGR) agriculture fraternity house where he engaged in a playful activity of tossing footballs onto a beer pong table before a crowd of onlookers. Recent polling data from Iowa, conducted in collaboration with Iowa State, indicates that Trump is currently enjoying majority support at 51 percent in the lead-up to the January caucuses, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis trailing far behind at just 14 percent, a significant drop from his previous position. DeSantis's campaign, which had previously emphasized the necessity of winning Iowa, now acknowledges that a "strong second" might suffice, and they even suggest that winning no states might still secure the nomination. Notably, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who had once been seen as a potential 2024 contender, has now openly endorsed Trump, strengthening his position in the race.
